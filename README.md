# ai-polit
AI for politics. My toys to measure politics using NLP and AI techniques.


Testing
=======

To run all tests type (use -s for debug show of prints ;) ):

    pytest tests

To run specific test put path to the test file:

    pytest tests/t_preprocessors/test_text_cleaners.py

Scripts
=======

References to scripts. We use the following naming convention for scripts:

    aipolit-{TOPIC_PREFIC}-{COMMAND_NAME}.py

Where TOPIC_PREFIX is one of the topics mentioned later in this document (check section *Topics*).

Scripts are stored in "bin/" directory.


Topics
======

Each topic refers to specific NLP/AI/Analytic task. It can e.g. analytucs

The following topics are handled in this repository:
- *sejmvote* - scripts to analyze results from Sejm Elections
- *polittweets* - scripts to analyze political tweets
- *ttgen* - tweet generation algorithms
- *transcript* - analytics based on hipisejm transcripts
- *utils* - helper scripts and utilities

Topic: sejmvote
===============

You will need to download some data first.
Please check aipolit.utils.globals for the files which need to be prepared
(they are described in comments).

sejmvote-retrieve-voting-place-location.py
------------------------------------------

Use this script to retrieve latitude and longitude of the voting places.
The data is saved on the disc, so you will need to retrieve them only once
to use in other analytic tasks.


Topic: polittweets
==================

TBD

Topic: ttgen
============

TBD

Topic: utils
============

TBD


Topic: Transcripts
==================

Analysing transcripts is an interesting way to understand langauge of Polish politics.
In `aipolit/transcript` you will find several scripts which aim to analyse discourse of the Polish Parliament.
It is based on the data parsed by `hipisejm` module (so please refer to its README for details).


bin/aipolit-transcript-affiliation-www-parser.py
------------------------------------------------

Finding Parliament speakers political affiliation is not straightforward task.
I wrote special class `aipolit/transcript/person_affiliation.py` to handle that (check unit tests for its usage)
but it requires data to work correctly. The script `bin/aipolit-transcript-affiliation-www-parser.py` help to build such data.


In general you should:
1. Run the script to produce new file to be uploaded (check script description for details)
2. Review file produced by the script
3. Copy it to the repository.


Notebooks
=========

References to notebooks. In most cases notebooks are draft pieces of code.
Some of them might be published.

001_characteristic_words_for_tt_descriptions (unpublished)
----------------------------------------------------------

First experiment on MP's account description and algorithm to find characteristic words.
Two approaches:

1. Random Forest + feature weights
2. LIME explanation (also on Random Forest)

A playground for more challanging tasks ;)


002_experiment_with_tweet_identification_for_sejm_parties (unpublished)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Very similar to previous notebook, but the classification task is different - this time we collected
tweets for all MPs from the given year, and try to identify who wrote the tweet.

Then the classifier is used to identify characteristic words.

007_dzielnice_krakowa_wybory2023
--------------------------------

This notebook creates data for XLSX with Sejm2023 election results summarized for each
Krak√≥w district (useful to analyse it for regional elections).
